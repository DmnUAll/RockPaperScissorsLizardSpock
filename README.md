This project was the sixth app writen by myself. It helped me to understand an UIImageView, Timer and DispatchQueue methods a little further. The app have a transition to another screen (as a popup). 

At some moment - the project was refactored to exclude a storyboard UI design. All UI is writen by code since then, but i saved my first project realisation into a separate branch, called ui_by_storyboard(before_refactoring).
